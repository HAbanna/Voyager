Adinath Temple situated at Moheshkhali Island, which island is a beautiful island in the Bay of Bengal in the north-western side of Cox’s Bazar. Very easy to visit from Cox's Bazar. You can easily spend one evening at this island. The temple is on the top of a small hill. So far, I can't find out the information of the establishment of this temple. To visit Moheshkhali, you must consider the tide to make your journey more comfortable.
